TThis project is a machine learning regression model that predicts the output temperature of a cement calciner using various input features. Calcination is a process where calcium carbonate is converted to calcium oxide and carbon dioxide, and several physical and chemical factors govern the process. Machine learning algorithms are powerful tools which are able to perform better on numerical data with one or more dependent variable and a series of independent variable.

Getting Started
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/calciner-temp-model.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd calciner-temp-model
Install the necessary dependencies
Use the CalcinerModel(small).h5 script to make predictions on new data

Data
The model is trained on a dataset of cement calciner input and output temperature data. The data should be in the form of a CSV file with columns for each input feature and a column for the output temperature.you can use the given data to make your own model. EDA as already been performed on it.

Features
Prediction of cement calciner output temperature using input features such as raw material temperature, gas temperature, and others.
Model evaluation using metrics such as Mean Squared Error and R-Squared.
Comparison of various machine learning regression algorithms and selection of the best performing one, Artificial Neural Network.
Feature extraction and selection as well as exploratory data analysis.
